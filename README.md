Simon is an game of memory skill invented by Ralph H. Baer and Howard J. Morrison, working for toy design firm Marvin Glass and Associates,with software programming by Lenny Cope. The device creates a series of tones and lights and requires a user to repeat the sequence. If the user succeeds, the series becomes progressively longer and more complex. Once the user fails or the time limit runs out, the game is over.

How to play:

1. Press the any key to start the game. A colored button will beep . Repeat the signal by pressing the same colored button.

2. Simon will duplicate the first signal and add one. Repeat these two signals by pressing the same color buttons, in order.

3. Simon will duplicate these first two signals and add one.

4. Continue playing as long as you can repeat each sequence of signals correctly.

5.If you fail to repeat a sequence exactly a  "RAZZ" sound will be played. This means you've lost, and the sequence of signals ends.
